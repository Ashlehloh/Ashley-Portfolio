# 🍔 Food Image Classifier Model - Fine-tune pre-trained CNN InceptionV3

This project was developed as part of the **Deep Learning** module.

The objective of this assignment is to build an image classification model capable of recognising and classifying **10 different types of food** using a subset of the Food-101 dataset from Kaggle.

The project focuses on applying transfer learning with a pre-trained convolutional neural network and following a structured machine learning workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation and real-world testing. I have tuned a pre-trained InceptionV3 model to be able to classify the different food images.
