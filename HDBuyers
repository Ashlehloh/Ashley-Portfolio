This group project is a data analytics and DataOps project built on Snowflake to support first-time HDB resale buyers in understanding price trends, affordability and neighbourhood context.
The project focuses on designing a curated analytical layer in Snowflake and building an interactive Power BI dashboard to help users explore resale price behaviour across towns, flat types and remaining lease profiles.
This repository contains the SQL logic used to prepare and transform the datasets for reporting.

🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
  design an analytics-ready data layer in Snowflake
  transform raw and semi-structured datasets into curated views
  support business questions related to:
    resale price trends
    affordability across locations and flat types
    remaining lease perception
    proximity to key neighbourhood amenities

Data preparation optimised for direct Power BI consumption

👩‍💻 My Role
I was responsible for Resale, environment and sport facilities datasets.

My contributions include:
  handling missing data
  removing duplicates
  handling different data types
  defining primary keys
  curating of data dictionary

🛠️ Tech Stack

Snowflake
SQL
Power BI

🗂️ Data Used

Curated datasets include:
  HDB resale transaction data
  (price, flat type, storey range, floor area, remaining lease, geolocation, transaction date)
  HDB property information
  (block-level supply and completion details)
  Neighbourhood datasets:
    hawker centres
    healthcare facilities
    sports amenities
    bus stops
    community clubs
    car parks

🧠 What this project demonstrates

Analytical data modelling for dashboard use cases
Writing maintainable and reusable SQL in Snowflake
Designing metrics that reflect real buyer decision factors
Translating business questions into data transformations
Supporting self-service analytics through a curated layer


▶️ How to Use

Load the source datasets into Snowflake
Execute the SQL scripts in the sql/ folder
Connect Power BI to the generated views
Build visuals using the curated tables and views

📌 Notes

This repository focuses on the data preparation and analytics layer used for the Power BI dashboard.
Dashboard visuals are created separately and consume the Snowflake views produced here.

This project was completed as part of a data analytics and DataOps coursework project and demonstrates my ability to design Snowflake-based analytical datasets and support real-world dashboard use cases for housing market analysis.
