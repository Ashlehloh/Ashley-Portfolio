# 🏠 HDB Buyers 
🔗 Repository: https://github.com/DylanLHW/HDBuyers-Snowflake

This is a team-based data analytics and DataOps project built on Snowflake to support first-time HDB resale buyers in understanding price trends, affordability and neighbourhood context.

The project focuses on designing a curated analytical layer in Snowflake and building an interactive Power BI dashboard to help users explore resale price behaviour across towns, flat types and remaining lease profiles.

This repository contains the SQL logic used to prepare and transform the datasets for reporting.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Design an analytics-ready data layer in Snowflake
- Transform raw and semi-structured datasets into curated views
- Support business questions related to:
  - resale price trends
  - affordability across locations and flat types
  - remaining lease perception
  - proximity to key neighbourhood amenities
- Optimise data preparation for direct Power BI consumption

## 👩‍💻 My Role

I was responsible for preparing and curating the **HDB resale**, **environment** and **sports facilities** datasets.

My contributions include:

- Handling missing and inconsistent data
- Removing duplicate records
- Standardising and validating data types
- Defining primary keys and basic relationships
- Curating and documenting the data dictionary for the assigned datasets

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Snowflake  
- SQL  
- Power BI

---

## 🗂️ Data Used

Curated datasets include:

- **HDB resale transaction data**  
  (price, flat type, storey range, floor area, remaining lease, geolocation, transaction date)
- **HDB property information**  
  (block-level supply and completion details)
- **Neighbourhood datasets**, including:
  - hawker centres
  - healthcare facilities
  - sports amenities
  - bus stops
  - community clubs
  - car parks

## 🧠 What this project demonstrates

- Analytical data modelling for dashboard use cases
- Writing maintainable and reusable SQL in Snowflake
- Designing metrics that reflect real buyer decision factors
- Translating business questions into data transformations
- Supporting self-service analytics through a curated data layer

---

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Load the source datasets into Snowflake
2. Execute the SQL scripts in the `sql/` folder
3. Connect Power BI to the generated views
4. Build visuals using the curated tables and views

## 📌 Notes

This repository focuses on the data preparation and analytics layer used for the Power BI dashboard.  
Dashboard visuals are created separately and consume the Snowflake views produced here.

This project was completed as part of a data analytics and DataOps coursework project and demonstrates my ability to design Snowflake-based analytical datasets and support real-world dashboard use cases for housing market analysis.
