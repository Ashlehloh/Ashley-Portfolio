# ✈️ Flight Information Display System
🔗 Repository: https://github.com/allergictoshellfishh/S10266970_PRG2Assignment

This project is a console-based Flight Information Display System (FIDS) developed for my Programming 2 module assignment.

The system simulates the operations of Terminal 5 at Changi Airport, allowing airport staff to manage daily flight information, boarding gate assignments and airline billing using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

The application loads flight, airline and boarding gate data from CSV files and provides an interactive menu-driven interface for managing flights throughout a single operational day.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The goal of this assignment was to:

- Design and implement a multi-class object-oriented system  
- Apply relationships between classes such as association and aggregation  
- Handle real-world constraints such as:
  - unique flight numbers per day
  - limited boarding gates
  - special boarding requirements
- Perform validation for all user inputs
- Implement sorting, collections and file handling

---

## 🧱 Key Features

### Basic Features

- Load airlines, flights and boarding gates from CSV files
- Display all flights and boarding gates
- Assign boarding gates to flights
- Create, modify and delete flight records
- Display full flight details by airline
- Display all scheduled flights in chronological order
- Input validation for all user actions

### Advanced Features

- Automatically assign unassigned flights to suitable boarding gates in bulk  
  (based on availability and special request requirements)
- Compute daily airline fees and promotional discounts, including:
  - arrival and departure fees
  - boarding gate base fees
  - special request code fees
  - stackable promotional discounts

---

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- Implemented using a C# console application
- Designed using an object-oriented architecture based on a provided class diagram
- Uses:
  - dictionaries and collections for fast lookups
  - queues for bulk flight processing
  - file I/O for loading and appending CSV data
- Flights implement `IComparable<T>` to support chronological sorting

---

## 🧩 System Capabilities

The system supports:

- Tracking flight information (flight number, airline, origin, destination, time, status)
- Managing boarding gates and their supported special request codes
- Assigning gates manually and automatically
- Maintaining consistency such as:
  - one boarding gate per flight
  - one flight per gate per day
- Generating a detailed billing breakdown for each airline, including total fees and discounts

## 👩‍💻 What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- Object-oriented design and class responsibility separation
- Data validation and defensive programming
- Collection-based data management
- Implementing real-world business rules in code
- Building maintainable and extensible console applications

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
2. Ensure the CSV files (`airlines.csv`, `flights.csv`, `boardinggates.csv`) are present in the project directory
3. Run the console application
4. Follow the interactive menu to manage the system

This project was completed as part of a graded Programming 2 assignment and demonstrates my ability to design and implement a structured object-oriented system with real-world operational logic.
